# Search-and-Rescue
Autonomous Search and Rescue Robot Disasters make rescue operations risky and slow. Our semi-autonomous robot uses ESP32-CAM, thermal sensors, GPS, and IoT to detect victims, navigate debris, and provide first-aid before responders arrive. With AI, ultrasonic sensors, and remote monitoring, it enhances disaster response efficiency.
